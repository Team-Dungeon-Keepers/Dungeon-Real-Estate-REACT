# Dungeon-Site

## Project Description
During this COVID epidemic, it has become harder to find groups of people to play games with, both in person and remotely. The Dungeon Site application is a social meetup application. Dungeon Site is intended to allow for the creation, detailing, and scheduling of such games. Details provided include addresses, behaviors expected at the table, languages spoken, links to third party resources, and the game schedule.

## Technologies Used
* React
* Java
* JavaScript
* HTML/CSS
* NodeJS
* Axios
* Spring 
* Spring Boot 
* Spring MVC 
* Spring Data 
* PostGres 
* Heroku
## Features
* Users can create accounts and login to the dungeon site system
* Users can create, join and schedule games at self defined locations, times, using various systems.
* Users can view the games they've created and the ones they have joined with all the information of each game listed.
* Users can search for games by ID, game master, or game name.
To-do list:

* The ability for users to add each other as friends, to then view and invite each other to games.
* The ability to edit games after they have been created, and kick certain players from the game.
* The ability for users to communicate with each other in real time via chat messaging.
